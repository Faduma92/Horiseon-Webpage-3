# Horiseon-Webpage-3
New and Improved Horiseon Webpage I have improved the accessibility standards of the webpage and made the code easier to understand by other developers. It is also more accessible on mobile devices improving brand visibility.

I sectioned off parts of the code using HTML semantics and gave the code logical structure by grouping classes with similar attributes. I also rearranged parts of the CSS file so that the code has a logical structure beginning with the header and ending with the footer.

I added comments to both the HTML and CSS files and alt attributes to all the images which improves the webpage's accessibility.
